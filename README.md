Greetings Mortals, Ever feel bewildered by technology?  Rest assured, you'll never be as bewildered as I be.  I do be bewildered.  And, I'm open to the idea of being post-bewildered.  Unwildered?  Non-wildered?  

So, I'm teaching myself to code.  (Disclaimer:  I only learn things the hard way.  Follow me at your own peril.)

Internetting is hard for introverts.
